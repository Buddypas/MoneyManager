# MoneyManager

MoneyManager is a toy app for tracking one's expenses and incomes. It is meant to be a quick experiment with the Kotlin Flow APIs.
The architecture is MVVM using Flows instead of LiveData. Hilt is used for DI and Room for storing data. My plan is to make it a real app when I get the time.
